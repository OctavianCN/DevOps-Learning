Inventories:

  An inventory defines a collection of hosts that Ansible will manage. These hosts can also be
assigned to groups, which can be managed collectively. Groups can contain child groups, and
hosts can be members of multiple groups. The inventory can also set variables that apply to the
hosts and groups that it defines
Inventory Example:

[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com
192.0.2.42
[db-servers]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com
[east-datacenter]
web1.example.com
db1.example.com
[west-datacenter]
web2.example.com
db2.example.com
[production]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com
db1.example.com
db2.example.com
[development]
192.0.2.42

Nested Groups Example:

[usa]
washington1.example.com
washington2.example.com
[canada]
ontario01.example.com
ontario02.example.com
[north-america:children]

Simplifying Host Specifications with Ranges:

[usa]
washington[1:2].example.com
[canada]
ontario[01:02].example.com

Ansible inventory commands:

  Your ansible command must include the -i inventory option. This makes
ansible use your inventory file in the current working directory instead of the
system /etc/ansible/hosts inventory file

commands:
  ansible all -i inventory --list-hosts
  ansible ungrouped -i inventory --list-hosts
  ansible development -i inventory --list-hosts
