Writing Loops and Conditional Tasks:

  Task Iteration with Loops:

    Examples:

      - Simple Loops:
          vars:
            mail_services:
              - postfix
              - dovecot
          tasks:
            - name: Postfix and Dovecot are running
              service:
                name: "{{ item }}"
                state: started
                loop: "{{ mail_services }}"
      
      - Loops over a List of Hashes or Dictionaries:
          - name: Users exist and are in the correct groups
            user:
              name: "{{ item.name }}"
              state: present
              groups: "{{ item.groups }}"
              loop:
                - name: jane
                  groups: wheel
                - name: joe
                  groups: root
      - Using Register Variables with Loops:

          - name: Loop Register Test
            gather_facts: no
            hosts: localhost
            tasks:
              - name: Looping Echo Task
                shell: "echo This is my item: {{ item }}"
                loop:
                  - one
                  - two
                register: echo_results
              - name: Show stdout from the previous task.
                debug:
                  msg: "STDOUT from previous task: {{ item.stdout }}"
                loop: "{{ echo_results['results'] }}"

  Conditional Task Syntax:

      ---
      - name: Simple Boolean Task Demo
        hosts: all
        vars:
          run_my_task: true
        tasks:
          - name: httpd package is installed
            yum:
              name: httpd
              state: present
            when: run_my_task
  
        when: >
        ( ansible_distribution == "RedHat" and
        ansible_distribution_major_version == "7" )
        or
        ( ansible_distribution == "Fedora" and
        ansible_distribution_major_version == "28" )
