Managing Facts:

    Ansible facts are variables that are automatically discovered by Ansible on a managed host. Facts
    contain host-specific information that can be used just like regular variables in plays, conditionals,
    loops, or any other statement that depends on a value collected from a managed host.
    Some of the facts gathered for a managed host might include:
      • The host name
      • The kernel version
      • The network interfaces
      • The IP addresses
      • The version of the operating system
      • Various environment variables
      • The number of CPUs
      • The available or free memory
      • The available disk space
